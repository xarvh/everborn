GAME VICTORY CONDITION

A player wins when most of theother players recognize her mastery.

Each player is randomly assigned a condition for which she'll be forced
to recognise another's mastery.

This considion is negotiable between any couple of players.




A player wins the game when she meets the enemy victory conditions (EVC) of
at least half of the other players.

More than one player can be declared winner if they reach enough EVC at the
same time.

Each player has a Basic EVC that is normally unknown to the other players.

Each player must always have at least one EVC in place for each of the other
players: fallback is on the Basic EVC.

EVCs between two players can be negotiated and agreed upon.
It must be possible to craft such contract as to explicitly or implicitly allow
ally victories.

EVCs must be such that playing the game with no attention to them, a powerful
enough player will eventually meet them all.

When a player meets the EVC of another player, the event is declared to all
and opportunely displayed in the Diplomacy menu, but the triggering EVC is not
disclosed.
(This means that who meets the EVC or who has a good overview of the current
events may figure out what the triggering EVC was).

A player can voluntarily disclose his basic EVC to another player.



basic EVCs:
"You will allow victory for a player that has:"
	(absolute condition:) "half of the worlds..."
	(relative condition:) "twice, with a minimum of XX, your..."
	"...wealth"
	"...contracts"
	"...nodes"
	"...cities"     
	"...troops" (calculated as total production or summon cost and enchantements cost)
	"...magic skill" (relative only)
	"...known spells" (absolute only, and one quarter instead than half seems more likely)
	"...books" (for the absolute, one quarter is enough)
	"...retorts" (again, more one quarter than half)


new retort: ("Machiavellian")
    Can see all Contracts and all other's EVCs.

Advantages of the system:

 * Allows players to just play without any regards to basic victory conditions,
    a powerful enough player will eventually meet all requirements and win.

 * Diplomacy becomes extremely powerful, important and twisted, as diplomacy is
    supposed to be (in the game, diplomacy is partially binding).

 * No need to ever kick out players from the game, as they cannot really "lose"
    untill they lose all together.

 * Possibility of multiple winner through "if I win, I declare you winner" type
    contracts (diplomacy is to be based on contracts)
