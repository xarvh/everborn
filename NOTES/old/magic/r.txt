
Runes belong to each of the four Elements: Air, Water, Earth, Fire.
The possibility to add also Time and Soul should be considered.

Runes are manufactured in cities with a Fortress or a Forge (the Forge has no requirements).
They cost both manpower and mana, but can be stored and used at any time.

To ability of a wizard to store runes of a particualr Element depends on the pics taken
in that Element.
If a player has not enough "store capability" he won't be able to store nor produce the more
powerful runes.
A background explaination should be found.

For example, you take 3 pics in Earth, 2 in Water and 1 in Fire.
Then you'll have access to Common Earth, Water and Fire Runes and a few of Uncommon Earth
Runes.
You will have:

21 Slots for Common Earth Runes
12 Slots for Common Water Runes
5 Slots for Common Fire Runes
5 Slots for Uncommon Earth Runes


Here is the rule:

Picks		C	U	R
1		5	0	0
2		12	0	0
3		21	5	0
4		32	12	0
5		45	21	5
6		60	32	12

It should be still adjusted but seems fair.
Of course if a wizard is able to have runes of a certain level, he will be able to research
and use ALL the runes of that level.

I'll add systems allowing the cities to automatically produce runes without bother the
player.

A Runic Wizard can be cna choose these retorts (1 pick each)

Sage,
Warlord,
Alchemist,
Famous,
Charismatic,
Spellmaster (That will allow to choose SpellBooks and throw spells)
Artificer,
Myrran,
Earthlord,
Firelord,
Waterlord,
Airlord,
ElementalMaster.
