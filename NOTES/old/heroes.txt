 XARVH HEROES

 Heroes are randomly spawned from cities: they will travel on the map searching for glory
 and fame, and may offer their service to a wizard.
 When standard a unit reaches Elite level, it has chance to became an hero.
 The newborn hero may ask to leave the army (and maybe rejoin later) or a promotion.
 Refusing both promotion and freedom will cause the hero and surrounding units to reduce
 their loyalty.

 Chances of city spawning an hero:
  1 on 1000 per city per turn
  modified by number of heroes around.

 Chances of Elite Unit becaming Hero:
  1 on 1000 per Elite unit per turn
  modified on number of heroes around

 When a hero is created, it will be assigned all the HeroDefaultSpecials
 plus some (no more than 4) from the HeroAllowedOptionals.
 Also, each Hero had 1 on 100 chance to gain a generical Skill.

 Specials can be divided into Concepts (not cumulable) and Skills.
 Unit Gold Upkeep will be twice the standard unit.
 A Unit that already has a magic weapons will have the weapon in one of
 the Item Slots.
