everborn
========

Everborn is a turn-based multiplayer fantasy strategy game, with real-time
battles.

It has been my pet project for several years, but I abandoned it eventually,
as I realized that the game wasn't well-thought and the game rules ended up
being overly convoluted.

The original project is hosted on SourceForge: http://everborn.sourceforge.net/
There you will a bit more information and some screenshots.
